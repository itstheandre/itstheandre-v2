<TLDR>
  <p>
    After the pandemic started, the team behind Savorly decided to move their
    previous e-commerce platform from Wix to a more custom solution.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    This project was a collaboration with my super talented colleague Dalina.
    After working with her during my time at Ironhack, we both had a great flow
    and working on this project was also our first jump into freelancing.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    After researching through different technologies, we decided that in order
    to get a better combination between performance and also pretty confident
    platform for e-commerce, we would use technologies that we were already
    pretty comfortable with - React.js.

#### <span style={{marginRight:"8px"}}>🏗️</span> Case study

### We're going to eat bad stuff? Might as well be healthy, then!

Savorly was created to make it easier to get together and enjoy time with friends and family. They created a line of party bites and gratins to make sure they could be enjoyed in these times. And specially during the Covid-19 pandemic, when access to stores was totally limited, they realized that they had to ramp up their e-commerce efforts.

### Ready or not, here we go

No matter how much people tell you this, one thing is to develop a small personal project, the other thing is when you actively start applying this to real clients, the pressure ramps up tremendously.

Going from a pre-existing store gives us even a little more pressure, because whenever we go live, we also have to be sure that whenever we make the change we have the lowest down time possible.

In our personal projects, 1 day down, its manageable. In a client scenario, 1 hour is possibly hundreds of dollars lost. And with this, we can't play. It's people's money we are dealing with.

### We stand here today, in shoulders of giants, and at least a Canadian titan

First step of building a project as a junior developer?

  <span style={{ marginRight: "8px" }}>👉</span> Understand what are the needs
  of the project
</p>
<p>
  <span style={{ marginRight: "8px" }}>👉</span> Research what are the possible
  best tools for this.
</p>
<p>
  <span style={{ marginRight: "8px" }}>👉</span> Get overwhelmed by what the
  internet says. Because there are hundreds of different ways to tackle this
  challenge
</p>
<p>
  <span style={{ marginRight: "8px" }}>👉</span> There we go, repeat this
  hundreds of times until we throw caution to the wind and use the tools we are
  familiar with
