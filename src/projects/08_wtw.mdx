<TLDR>
  <p>
    In mid-late 2020, this team had an opportunity to fully revamp the website
    of a tax consultancy firm in Munich. Truth be told we not only wanted to
    redesign the website, but wanted to give it a "face-lift".
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    The website that was up at the start of our work, it was not the fastest
    experience, it was only in one language (german) and it clealy was not a
    modern website
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    So, we assembled a website that implemented newer features and a better and
    faster experience with bi lingual capabilities. In today's world you can't
    be too careful and not have your website in english (at least)

#### <EmojiWrapper>ðŸ’°</EmojiWrapper> Idea and money flow

#### The wonders of working with a designer with experience in web development

Previously, both me and Dalina have worked with wonderful designers, don't get me wrong. But working with someone that already has had experience designing websites (Catarina) gave us so much more freedom and flexibility. All components were built in the several sizes to the point that we just had to build components once and they would, truly, be reusable. Up to this point, all of our work was an experience in checking and building components as they would appear, instead of having one unified approach.

The website was built, using Sanity to give the clients the opportunity to write their content in both languages and, a website-wide toggle, allows any user just to figure out the language that it should be seen.

We take these things for granted, but now it woudn't be too hard, with the current setup, to just introduce more languages to be fair.

This client work also gave us the chance to experiment with other technologies like Framer-Motion - a React library that just has a brilliant animation API and that made the experience of building smooth and beautiful applications so nice,

#### Team wide complexity managed by communitcation

If there is one thing that I've taken from all my work previously with both Catarina and Dalina, is that the more we work together the less we actually **need** to meet, but the more we communicate. We are able to manage more complex technologies and more complex workflows in an easier and streamlined way.
