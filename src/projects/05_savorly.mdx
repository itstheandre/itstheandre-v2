<TLDR>
  <p>
    After the pandemic started, the team behind Savorly decided to move their
    previous e-commerce platform from Wix to a more custom solution.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    This project was a collaboration with my super talented colleague Dalina.
    After working with her during my time at Ironhack, we both had a great flow
    and working on this project was also our first jump into freelancing.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    After researching through different technologies, we decided that in order
    to get a better combination between performance and also pretty confident
    platform for e-commerce, we would use technologies that we were already
    pretty comfortable with - React.js.
