            I am a developer and a teacher from Lisbon üáµüáπ. I have an atypical
            path. I studied marketing and advertising and have worked in event
            management, business development and sales, building management, and
            also, at one point, at a bar. So yeah, not your usual developer
            story.

            Truth is I have always been more fascinated by technology and
            computers than anything else. From an early age I fell in love with
            computers and always wanted to, eventually, learn coding. Then in my
            business career I always felt frustrated because I could not build
            the ideas and projects I had in my mind.

            A few years later I have worked hard and turned myself into a
            developer, a freelancer, a tinkerer that keeps building new exciting
            ideas (at least for me). I have built projects for clients in the
            US, UK and Germany, in industries like e-commerce, finance and
            consulting.{" "}

            On top of all this, I am a teacher for Ironhack in its remote
            bootcamp where I try to help students break into the industry that
            has always fascinated me. I try to pass not only the skills but also
            the excitement for this life and promising career path
