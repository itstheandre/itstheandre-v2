## React, we have a problem

React.js has, let's say, a "situation" with the concept of `state`. First of all, it goes agains't the mental model of most beginners. You click on the button, and the number get's higher. That's it. Plain and simple. However, in the React land, even though it, actually, does that, designing this isn't as simple.

First, you have to adhere to the flux style of data flow from React. After that, you **never** mutate state directly. And then, you need to call one function that, in the background and not in a synchronous fashion, is going to call "React" in oder for it to eventually rerender that specific component with the updated data. There, I managed to overly simplify and probably even butcher an explanation of state.

After teaching state and seeing students learn about state enough times, you see that there are a couple of things that can be overwhelming but, even then, simple state (like the previous example with a button and a counter) eventually becomes easier to parse. And I am not talking about you, you super expert developer, I am talking from my own personal experience as somoene that had to learn state and to this day still tries making this topic easier to grasp.

After a while, state becomes easier to follow and then... BOOM, passing the state down. After a while, you hear about Redux, BOOM! Context, BOOM! Async state and local state, BOOM. Side effects, global state, all that. Just Ka-boom all over the place.

### First things first

I don't have any prejudice against React Context, Redux, Apollo, Relay, whatever. They all are trying to solve one problem and, depending on the problem, we can go to one or the other. Like everything, there is no direct final answer. [It Depends](/blog/it-depends)

Now, one of the reasons why I am going to be writing about Zustand is very simple. It's because it's simple. It's so simple. It has a very nice API footprint, and, more important (at least for me) it doesn't make me wrap the components in providers when I am writing tests.

That piece of state becomes as available as you need it and there it is, **simple**.

### What does it look like?

First, we need to install it:

```bash
FAVORITE_PACKAGE_MANAGER install zustand
```

And then, in a file (I advise file) because it will be the main one that will be focused on that state. No need to put everything in one file.

```ts
import create from "zustand";

const useStore = create((set) => ({
  isWorking: true,
  toggleWorking: () => set((state) => ({ isWorking: !isWorking })),
}));
```

And there, now we can just retrieve those two variables anywhere in the whole application - navbar, footer, 10000m nested inside other components. It just works. And that is one of the promises that I had when I started learning React. And now I know that **IT DEPENDS**.

```tsx
function NavBar() {
  const isWorking = useStore(state => state.isWorking)
  return (
    <div>I am{isWorking?"" : " not"} working
  );
}
```

```tsx
function SuperNestedComponent() {
  const toggleWorking = useStore((state) => state.toggleWorking);
  const isWorking = useStore((state) => state.isWorking);
  return (
    <div>
      {isWorking ? (
        <>Maybe take a break. Click → </>
      ) : (
        <>Well, back to work →</>
      )}{" "}
      <button onClick={toggleWorking}>REST A LITTLE</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

As you can see these components are connected, but if we are to analyze the root component, no provider. Plain and simple react.

### Final spinkles of brilliance for whenever we setup the initial useStore

Have you ever heard of immer?

If not, you should take a look at it. Not because it's going to save the world. But, at least in my opinion, it makes React state look closer to javascript objects and arrays.

### What? They are objects and arrays!

That's true, but since we work in an environment where they are not mutable (or shouldn't mutated), it's the same thing as you telling me they are strings or numbers. But immer, uses some underlying strategies that, whatever you mutate there, it will return the final state. Look at this example from their [docs](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/docs/introduction)

```tsx
import produce from "immer";

const baseState = [
  {
    todo: "Learn typescript",
    done: true,
  },
  {
    todo: "Try immer",
    done: false,
  },
];

const nextState = produce(baseState, (draftState) => {
  draftState.push({ todo: "Tweet about it" });
  draftState[1].done = true;
});
```

I don't know about you, but for me this just makes me smile and giggle a little. You can trade this:

```tsx
// imagine in a reducer
case "CHANGE_NESTED":{
  return {
    ...state,
    projects: state.projects.map(project => {
      if (project.exams[1].id === action.payload.id) {
        return {...project, exams: project.exams.map(exam => exam.id === action.payload.id ? {...exam, extra:action.payload.extra} : {...el})}
      }
      return project
    })
  }
}

```

Imagine this nested nightmare where you have to look 58 times just to try to follow vs:

```tsx
product(baseState, (draftState) => {
  draftState[projectId].exames[id].extra = extra;
});
```

For me this is so much more readable.

Now, let's do some magic.

Let's put both Zustand and Immer to work, and prepare to cry (of happiness):

NOTICE HERE, I didn't think of this, it's on [Zustand's repo](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand)

```tsx
import { State, StateCreator } from "zustand";
import produce, { Draft } from "immer";

const immer = <T extends State>(
  config: StateCreator<T, (fn: (draft: Draft<T>) => void) => void>
): StateCreator<T> => (set, get, api) =>
  config((fn) => set(produce(fn) as (state: T) => T), get, api);

interface WorkingState {
  isWorking: boolean;
  toggleWorking: () => void;
}

const useStore = create<WorkingState>(
  immer((set) => ({
    isWorking: false,
    toggleWorking: () =>
      set((state) => {
        state.isWorking = !state.isWorking;
      }),
  }))
);
```

And that's it. Nowadays if I am building a simple application and want to go for speed of coding, even if I am writing in Typescript, I go got Zustand and Immer.

Happy coding

### And then we see forms.

Before people that are learning React are willing to even look at things such as [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form) or [Formik](https://formik.org), they first to understand what the hell is happening when managing state with forms. And they can go a couple of different routes:

```jsx
class LoginForm extends React.Component {
  state = {
    username: "",
    password: "",
  };

  onUsernameChange = (event) => this.setState({ username: event.target.value });

  onPasswordChange = (event) => this.setState({ password: event.target.value });

  render() {
    return (
      <form>
        <input
          name="username"
          placeholder="Add your username"
          type="text"
          value={this.state.username}
          onChange={this.onUsernameChange}
        />
        <input
          name="password"
          placeholder="Add your password"
          type="password"
          value={this.state.password}
          onChange={this.onPasswordChange}
        />
      </form>
    );
  }
}
```

You look at this and you can see that it's "fine" to read. You don't understand why the inputs have a value property and where doest that `event` come from in the on`something`Change methods, but you can accept it, maybe... maybe not.

As you might see, though, this is not the most scalable option. Not in a millions of users scalable, but in a multi part form. This would be a nightmare to manage.

Then you learn you can use somem JSFoo to abstract away those methods into one single method:

```jsx
export class SignupForm extends React.Component {

  onInputChange(event) => this.setState({[event.target.name]:event.target.value})
}
```

And boom. Now you are a magician. You can add as many inputs to this component and, as long as you match the name property in each input to their respective keys in state, you are golden.

## But then, passing state down

Then you learn about passing the state down to child components and, voila, you're confused again.

At one point, you become aware of the `Hooks` architecture and you see your eyes glow again. Everything is a function - much wow -, no more `this.` nonsense (not a nonsense, but by this time, there's no guarantee you fully grasp the this keyword yet) - much wowness -, and, usually, smaller componentes (in terms of lines written at least).

You now have a component decision to take, though. Because each state can be whatever shape, you can now have individual pieces of state for each `key` in the previous state. Like this:

```jsx
const [username, setUsername] = React.useState("");
const [password, setPassword] = React.useState("");
```

Which, in practice, has the same scalability situation:

```jsx
function onInputChange(event) {
  if (event.target.name === "username") {
    setUsername(event.target.value);
  }
  if (event.target.name === "password") {
    setPassword(event.target.value);
  }
}
```

Why do we do this? Becaues you first try to see what happens if you put it all in one object, and the moment you edit one input (if you do the previous class component style), you lose the other key. For example:

```jsx
const [myFormState, setMyFormState] = React.useState({
  username:"",
  password:""
})

function onInputChange(event){
  setMyFormState({[event.target.name]:event.target.value})
}
// makes changes to username input:
console.log(myFormState) // {username:""}

// makes change to password input
console.log(myFormState // {password: ""})
```

It's not directly clear why if you change the username input, you lose the password property. The reason for this is that the second returned value from the `useState` hook is a full updater function. Whatever value that function has as an argument, or internal function, will be the **new** value of the first returned value.

Your solution is to basically `spread` the previous version of that form state and then, dynamically, updating the right key.

```js
function onInputChange(event) {
  setMyFormState({ ...myFormState, [event.target.name]: event.target.value });
}
```

Another way to do this would be:

```js
function onInputChange(event) {
  setMyFormState((prevVersion) => ({
    ...prevVersion,
    [event.target.name]: event.target.value,
  }));
}
```
