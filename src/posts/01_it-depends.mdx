# Okay, the title is super clickbaity

Two of the words I have repeated the most when teaching programming have been: It depends.

In a world where everything, and everyone, is becoming more and more ambiguous, the one that is direct and assertive is king. This seems to be the motto most people tend to follow this for most articles or youtube videos I see getting viral on youtube, medium or even, sometimes, DEV.to:

- The 10 most programming languages you **MUST** learn to get a job
- The 50 best brands for toilet paper for a tender tush swipe.
- The one computer to rule them all!

I tend to be very directive and assertive, but more and more I tend to fall more into the category of: it depends. Or, "I don't know, let me get back to you".

I dont't to be told what to think. I like to be told what's happening and then to take my time to analyze and come to my own conclusions.

I might eventually regret this, but I don't think I will fall into the trap of telling you what to think. I will present you with my own opinion, present you with some facts, but outside of that, I don't want pressure you to do A or B. Actually I will always try to finish any post I put here, with the hope you either were entertained, learned something or, at least, leave feeling ncier than you were before.

### Kind of left the trail, let's get back to coding

What is the best programming language to learn in 2021? It depends.
What is the best Javascript framework for frontend development? It depends
What is the best way to iterate over a nested array of nested arrays of booleans, strings or objects? It depends

I've heard students and people react to this by saying it's kind of a cop out. However, from what I know from myself, it sometimes actually is an invitatino for a longer conversation. But in reality, it's that there is no `one X to do Y`. Everything has it's trade-offs. There is no absolute best. Even in coding, what might make 100% for my mental model, might make 0%. And, thus, it might be the best for me, and not for you.

All this text to say that, good and bad is always going to be subjective. In life, in sports, in coding... You name it. For me, the nicest thing actually is: Tell me what is the way you like the most and maybe point me to other solutions. From there I will make up my mind ðŸ˜ƒ

Nothing in programming will be as straightforward as the human body needing to breathe to stay alive, and no matter what the article you read, or youtube video you watch or, in this case, no matter what I write will be set in stone. This article is actually open source so people can edit it - got sidetracked a little sorry.

No matter where it comes from, there will always be more than one way to look at one thing. No thing is best. You can have, theoretically, "better", but I suspect, never best!

That is my opinion. However, you are totally entitled to yours.

Cheers and happy living
